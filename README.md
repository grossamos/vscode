# VS Ultra

## Description

This is a fork of VS Ultra. Mainly for clout and Privacy

## Features

The main goal of this project was to distribute a more customised but highly reproducable distribution of vscode, that also doesn't track you like a wild ass morther fucker. It's basically a way of using vscode, while maintaining a strict "fuck microsoft" stance.

Feature list:
- Custormised iconset and images
- Removed (most) tracking
- Allowed access to the microsoft extension store, which for some fucking reason Code - OSS doesn't do by default.
